# Footfall-Analysis-in-Retail-Stores

### Real-time footfall analysis in retail stores

- Footfall analysis in real-time (supporting multiple video streams e.g., IP cameras, webcam) with a desktop app.
- Calculate demographics such as dwell times/heat maps at a particular location e.g., near shelfs.
- Customize the layout e.g., shelf control.
- People detection (using YOLO) along with age/gender detection if applicable.
- Track the path of customers in the stores.
- Analysis data is also stored in the logs.

**Example test run showcasing multiple video streams with customer detection/tracking, dwell times/heat maps:**
